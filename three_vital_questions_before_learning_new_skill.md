### TQWADSAHBSTFSOHMC or 
##### Three Vital Questions Which Any Developer Should Ask Himself Before Swallowing The First Sip Of His Morning Coffee
#

we are living in a world in which *TIME* is a really complex value. 
As a developer I used to have mornings, when I woke up with the horrifying thought of which new skill got trendy overnight.  
Let me tell you a mind blowing, one hundred percent scientific story: 

>In the medival era, there was a strong [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujata) among muslims called *Kujata*, it suggested that the universe is on the horns of a gigantic cow and the cow itself is on the back of an even bigger fish and the fish is in the water. 
Therefore the reason behind earthquakes was believed to be caused by the cow shaking it´s neck, when it got tired; too intuitive, right!?

Anyway I know, you are asking yourself what is the point? Actually I told you this story because I think, it is the first responsibility of any developer to know about ancient magical (mushroom) beliefs...  
Alright it was lame... so let´s cut the ancient cow-shit and talk business…  

I told you this story because I can see almost everyday horrified developers who are not sure what new skill acquire next. To be honest, most of them remind me of that whole cow-fish idea and their outcomes are just like the perfect theory on the origin of the earthquake.  

One of the very common situations is, when that skilled developer is supposed to do more than a simple task or needs to suggest a framework to use or mjust finished a 600 hours udemy course, is holding a golden certificate, but is scared to death when it comes to digging into the documentation and suggesting a defensible solution. Often the very same person likes walking into the office with a "Mr. Omniscient" lable on his shirt. 

I invite you to think about the following three questions, whenever you are rushing to append a new skill on your Linkedin page:  

* Do I have enough passion and knowledge and nerve to read and understand the skill’s official documentation?!(For example Keycloak)
* Is the new skill really a must-have or you just something you heard of over a beer talk!?  (Tipp: Use google trend to see how long is it, that this word is a buzz-word!?)  
* Will I be having any involvement with the new skill in the near future?  

And make sure you got three **yeses** in your pocket, otherwise you are actually trying to put a gigantic cow on the back of a damn blameless fish, for no reason and soon you will give birth to a semi-earthquake theory!  

So, let's admit it, nobody can keep up with the IT world's ever changing trends and new technologies and perhaps there is no need for it. The truth is all the existing perfect frameworks and tools are standing on the shoulders of the prime giants.  
So you think that you have to learn K8S, tell me, how well do you know Docker or the idea of the resource virtualisation?  
Or you think you have to absolutely start working with flutter? Then let me know, how comftable do you feel with EM and REM while changing the size of an image?!     
Do you still think that you can write the Authentication/Authorization mechanisem of your app on your own and still believe that the backend development world has nothing to give you anymore?!  
> Don't get me wrong, I´m not saying you don't need to learn anything new, I´m just saying finishing one new course without knowing what's really going on under the hood, will make you just more nervous...  

Think about it...
