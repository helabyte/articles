##### Three Vital Questions Which Any Developer Should Ask Himself Before Swallowing The First Sip Of His Morning Coffee
#

we are living in a world in which *TIME* is a really confusing value. 
As a developer I used to have mornings which I woke up with the horrifying thought of which new skill got trendy, while I was asleep last night. 
Let me tell you a mind blowing, one hundred percent scientific story: 

>In the medival era, there was a strong [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kujata) among muslims called *Kujata*, it suggested that the universe is on the horns of a gigantic cow and the cow itself is on the back of an even bigger fish and the fish is in the water. 
Therefore the reason behind earthquakes was believed to be that the cow got tired and shook its neck. too intuitive, right!?

Anyway I know, you are asking yourself what is the point? actually I told you this story cause I think, it is the first responsibility of any developer to know about ancient magical (mushroom) beliefs...  
Alright it was lame... so let´s cut the ancient cow-shit and talk business…  

I told you this story because I can see almost everyday horrified developers who are not sure what new skill to learn next. To be honest, most of them remind me of that whole cow-fish idea and the their outcomes are exactly like the perfect theory on the origin of the earthquake.  

One of the very common situations is when that skilled developer is supposed to do more than a simple task or need to provide a good answer why he/she suggesting that namely framework to use or more dramatic is when he actually got done with the 600 hours udemy course and he is holding a golden certificate but he is scared to death when it comes to digging into the documentation and suggest a defensible solution, who at the same time has a "Mr. Omniscient" lable on his shirt, when he walks into the office. 

I invite you to think about it , Whenever you are rushing to append a new skill on your Linkedin page without having a good solid basis knowledge of the these three points:

* Do I have enough passion and knowledge and nerve to read and understand the skill’s official documentation?!(For example Keycloak)
* Is the new skill really a must-have or you just something you heard of over a beer talk!?  (Tipp: Use google trend to see how long is it, that this word is a buzz-word!?)  
* Will I be having any involvement with the new skill in the near future?  


And make sure you got three **yes** answers in your pocket, otherwise you are actually trying to put a gigantic cow on the back of a damn blameless fish, for no reason and soon you will give birth to a semi-earthquake theory!  

So, let's admit it, nobody can keep up with the IT world's newcomers and honestly there is no need for it. The truth is all the existing perfect frameworks and tools are standing on the shoulders of the Prime gients.  
So you think that you have to learn K8S, tell me, how well do you know Docker or the idea of the resource virtualisation?  
Or you think you have to absolutely start working with flutter? Then let me know, how comftable do you feel with EM and REM while changing the size of an image?!     
Do you still think that you can write the Authentication/Authorization mechanisem of your app on your own and still belive that the backend development world has nothing to give you anymore?!  
> Don't get me wrong, I don't say you don't need to learn let's say K8S, I just say finishing a new course without knowing what's really going on under the hood, will make you just more nervous...  

Think about it...
