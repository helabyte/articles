##### Three Vital Questions Which Any Developer Should Ask Himself Before Swallowing The First Sip Of His Morning Coffee
#

we are living in a world, within *TIME* is a really confusing value!
As a developer I used to have mornings which I woke up with this horrifying thought that what on the earth new skill got trendy while I was asleep since last night!
Let me tell you a mind blowing, one hundred percent scientific story! 

>In ancient era, there was a strong belief that universe is on the horns of a gigantic cow and the cow itself is on the back of a more gigantic fish and the fish itself is in the water!
Therefore, reason of the earthquake is, times that the cow of our story gets tired and shake his neck! too intuitive, right!?

Anyway I told you this story cause I think, it is the first responsibility of any developer to know about ancient magical (mushroom) beliefs... I know, it was lame!  
Let’s cut the ancient cow-shit and talk business…  
I told you this story cause I can see almost everyday horrified developers, how are not sure what to learn as new skill! To be honest, They remind me of that whole cow-fish idea themselves and the their outcomes are exactly like the perfect idea of the origin of the earthquake!

I invite you to think about it , Whenever you are rushing to append a new skill on your Linkedin page without having a good solid basis knowledge of the these three points:

* Do I have enough passion and knowledge and nerve to read and understand the skill’s official documentation?!(For example Keycloak)
* Is the new skill really a must to have or you just heard of it in a bier talk!?  ( use google trend to see how long is it, that this word is a buzz-word !?)  
* Do I have any possible involvement with the new skill which I am going to learn latest in next one month after learning it!


And make sure you got three **yes** answer in your pocket, otherwise you are actually trying to put a gigantic cow on the back of a damn blameless fish, for now reason! 

Following I will try to sum up some prerequisite for some trendy skills and try to keep this list updated, so make sure you save this page!
